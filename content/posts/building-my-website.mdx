# Get Started
In an attempt to build my personal brand as a Full-stack developer and also create a centralised place for all of my work, accomplishments, learnings, writing and personal side projects I decided to build my own personal site.

I wanted one place on the internet that I could aggregate everything and not have multiple locations I needed to constantly keep up to date. A place where people could find me with similar interests.

Another reason, previously I have made my own website at [bonabrian.github.io](https://bonabrian.github.io) using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) I think the way I created and structured the project was not the best and caused it to be a bit complex to updated or maintained. That's why I decided to build this website from scratch.

Here's tech stack that I used to build this website

## TypeScript
I think [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is easy to read and debug.

## Next.js
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is simple to set up and get started with.

## Authentication
Using [next-auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) for authentication.

## PlanetScale
[PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) is a serverless database platform that is gaining interest amongst hobbyists in the industry lately for many good reasons: a generous free tier, the exciting [database branching model](https://planetscale.com/docs/concepts/branching), the scaling possibility, etc.

## Prisma
[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is a collection of tools that abstract away the complex works when working with a database for you: migrations, safe-typing, etc. It is a great complementary to TypeScript applications.

## Tailwind CSS
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) makes it easy to break down a styles into small reusable components.

## Hosting
Hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Google Analytics
This website is integrated with [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)

## Monitoring with Sentry
[Sentry](https://sentry.io) is a developer-first error tracking and performance monitoring platform that helps developers see what actually matters, solve quicker, and learn continuously about their applications. The steps are:

- Go to [https://sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to register for a free tier account.
- Add Sentry integration to Vercel.
- Install package

```shell
yarn add @sentry/nextjs
```

In this case, I only want Sentry in production and I do this to my `next.config.js`
```js
const { withSentryConfig } = require('@sentry/nextjs')

const SentryWebpackPluginOptions = { silent: true }

const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'

const nextConfig = {
  ...
}

module.exports = isDevelopment
  ? nextConfig
  : withSentryConfig(nextConfig, SentryWebpackPluginOptions)
```

# Conclusion

I love to build my sweet home on the internet, because I learned a lot from other people to building this site. I hope the future updates will be better and with more original ideas.

I hope you enjoyed and learned something from this post. Thank you! ðŸŽ‰
